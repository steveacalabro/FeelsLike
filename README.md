# FeelsLike
A weather app that describes what the weather truly “Feels Like”

##Description

This app is an app created at the 2015 Philly Code Fest.

### Others

* Other weather apps give you mass quantity of numbers.
* What exactly does this all mean?

### The Difference

* Our app describes the weather as you would describe it to your friends (but maybe not your parents)
* No one cares about actual temperature, we really only care about what it feels like
* We use the current conditions to create a random phrase


### Phrase Generation

* Temp is based on a 0-6 scale where 3 is neutral, 0-2 is cold and 4-6 is hot
* Wind and humidity are based on a 0-2 scale
* Type and severity of weather (normal, light, heavy) are also taken into effect
* We use these values to create different phrases about the weather. 
* for example: if the temp falls in the 1 range, the wind falls in the 2 range and there is heavy snow,  you would get a message like:
* “Whoa, it's freezing-ish and there is lots of snow and a fuck ton of fucking wind.”
* Some phrases are user submitted.
*More popular ones will be used more often while less popular ones will not
*eg: “If god were lactose intolerant and he ate a whole wheel of cheese… that would be the weather today.”
*“Holy frozen balls batman...”
*“It feels like the wind is stabbing me in the face.”
*Phrases can also be censored to make it a little more clean

### Social Networking

* You can like or dislike a phrase
* If you dislike the phrase you can suggest your own phrase
* If you really like the phrase you can post it to Facebook or twitter for all your friends to see
